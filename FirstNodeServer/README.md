### First Node Express Server

#### Progress & Learnings:

- I was extremely excited when we started back-end coding. We got to learn a lot of new things.
- I first learned how to create a new node express server.
- I learned how to assign a port to it in the process (and also what ports we cannot assign).
- After that, I learned about using the GET method where, for the home button, we can use "/" to tell the page what happens in the home button.
- We can also use the GET method for a lot of subpages that we want to have on our web server and the website.
- I learned about req and res which requests and recieves the data.
- We then learned about how to make a static folder which we named """ Public """.
- From that, we went on to learn the difference between the back-end console and the front-end console, and what commands change what part of the website.
- Then I learned how to make a custom API to host on your own server.
- Lastly, I learned how to access them using Query or Params on our webpage.
