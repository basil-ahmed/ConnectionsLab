##### Progress:

- I started with making the 3 blank files and then linking each of them to the index.html file.
- I wrote the HTML code (which becomes surprisingly small when compared to JavaScript).
- After writing the HTML code, I moved to JavaScript. Writing JavaScript was the hardest part (further explained in difficulties).
- I created an input text box and when pressed entered, it directly took in information. 
- However, after adding the second input box (type date), I realized I needed to create a 'Submit' button that takes information from both of the input boxes only when clicked and not when pressed 'Enter'. 
- Figuring that out took a while, however, I created that form.
- Next step was to show the inputs on the screen/html output. I created an empty list in HTMl file and then in JavaScript created the contents of what needs to go there.
- Every List Item, List content, and the done button was created as new assignments are added.
- The Background also changes to Red when an assignment is added (to portray danger)!
- Then, I added a feature where when Done button is pressed, the assignment is cancelled (With a line accross it).
- The Background also changes to Green when an assignment is checked off (to portray success)!
- This was done by changing the class of the list item when pressed done, and in CSS that class styling was done in a way that there is a line accross the text.
- Last, but not the least, comes CSS. I created a header, then styled the whole webpage.
- However, I realized that it was only one interaction (Adding elements into the list). I wanted to make something creative.
- With the help of a lot of researching, I added a feature in the website where when you click submit button, when you add a new assignment every time, the page changes color.
- But HEY! That's not it! Since I kept the height of the container auto, when there are enough assignemnts where you need to scroll the page down, scrolling generates and changes the webpage color everytime as well.
- I ADDED 3 INTERACTIONS TRYING TO BE CREATIVE!

##### Learnings:

- Taking readings of all input boxes with just one button.
- Trying to get into all the elements using the properties tab in Inspect.
- Debugging using Inspect.
- JavaScript connected to HTML.

##### Difficulties

- Even when the programming logic was easy, accessing the list elements or going through the list accesing certain things was extremely difficult (Almost gave up at one point).
- Changing the output on the the HTML using only JavaScript is still very difficult for me.
