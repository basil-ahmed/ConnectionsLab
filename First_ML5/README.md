## Using ML5 Assignment
### Object Detection Webpage

[Link to Website]()

#### Progress:

- I went on to ML5's Webpage to figure out what it does and how to deploy it into our webpages.
- I got to know that ML5 has machine learning built in libraries that we can use to detect images, sounds, videos, etc.
- The cool thing is we can also train our very own Machine Learning Model with ML5 and use it in our webpage.
- I downloaded a picture from the webpage of a car to test how correctly the model works.
- I went on the website followed all the steps.
- First for initialisation then for implementation of object detection.
- Even after that it was not working (How I fixed it is in learnings).
- Then I styled the page just a little bit and put in the ML model.
- It detected that it is a car absolutely correctly!

#### Learnings:

- We can train our very own Machine Learning Model with ML5 and use it in our webpage.
- The script tag has to be at the end of the page. It was not working otherwise, the model was giving a lot of errors.
- It does not give out what the object is but rather a list of 3 objects and the probability the model thinks of each of them.
- You just have to choose the highest probability object.
- We can do immense cool things with this library, and increase the user interactivity to make them have fun.
