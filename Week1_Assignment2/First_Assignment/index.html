            With the Coronavirus pandemic still very much a problem, practicing social distancing and staying away from others is especially important. However, this is difficult to do in enclosed and crowded areas. 
            Here is where the people counter can help. It keeps track of the number of people in a room or building by increasing a counter when people enter and decreasing the counter when people leave. Once the number of people in an area surpasses the maximum number of people allowed (which can be set by the user), an alarm will go off until the number of people is within bounds again.
            This can prevent buildings and rooms from being over crowded, which can help to limit the virus's spread by making social distancing easier to practice.
            The data gathered from the people counter will then be used and manipulated by p5js and the analysis can help the user to determine the pattern of occupancy in the room with regards to time on a certain day. Machine Learning can also be used to design an algorithm based on the data collected. This can help them to make policies to match the number of people in the room such as in the Library.
