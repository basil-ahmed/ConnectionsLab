Process:

- I started with creating a header of the webpage.
- At first I set the standard head tag. 
- Then, I linked my style.css file to my index.html file. 
- When I started making the header, I had difficulty positioning my heading/title and the home button.
- I wanted my title to be on the extreme right and the home button to be on the extreme left, however, I couldn't figure it out so after some research, I decided keeping them both in the center.
- Then I added the video and wanted the text to be on the right side. I used flex for this.
- After this section, I had to add a few images. I used flex and the css attributes for the height and the width to position them and size them.
- Half of the big picture was getting covered by 2 smaller pictures, so I had to divide them by classifying them as div and then applying flex on them.
- Then I added a section for socials and its links and then finally created the footer.
- Lastly, I decided on the colors and used css to color header/footer and then the background where the combination looks nice. I tried numerous colors until I got fixed on these.
- I also changed the text font in body in the end.
