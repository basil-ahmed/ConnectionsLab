### Project 1: World Food Recipes

[Link to Wesbite](https://basil-ahmed.github.io/ConnectionsLab/WorldFoodRecipes/)

#### Initial Idea:

My idea is to create a webpage on food recipes that come from all around the world. The webpage will be in a grid format where only the food of the picture will be displayed along with the dish’s name. When you hover over the image, it will flip and show you the recipe along with a link to the recipe’s youtube link. I will also place a search bar on the website and when a user searches something, from the grid, only those images/blocks will be left that match the search bar content. I will be using an open source API based on meals where I will get all the information I need. I am also thinking of creating another page using p5.js where there will be a map shown and when you go to a certain region, it will show you the meals based on that region. I might also divide the meals based on regions, or other categories, but for now, that is not part of the plan since I am trying to give as much accessibility as I can, especially by developing a search feature.

#### Progress (19th September 2022):
- I started with looking for an open-source WebAPI and came accross a lot of them. I founded [this](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) food recipe one and several ideas gushed my mind.
- I then came up with the initial idea that I have written above.
- So far, I have been able to get data from the JSON URL and I have been able to display that on my webpage. However, I still have to figure out a way for getting the pictures from the URL and directly display them on my webpage.
- The upcoming step is also dividing the website into a grid using html and css.

#### Learnings (19th September 2022):
- I learned how to fetch and use the JSON file data from anywhere.
- I learned how to create elements with JavaScript and use them to display data that I picked up from the internet. In other words, add data as the website is working and not pre-loaded (which is extremely cool).
- Lastly, I learned how to create an 'a' tag with JavaScript alone (I was confused on how to actually add the link I have to go to and not only the 'innerHTML').
